# Predicting_Customer_Churn

### Business Problem
There is much competition between different credit card companies these days. Each company is trying to offer the best of services and trying to become a monopolist in the market. But due to the recent trends in the market and also because of the COVID aftermath many people are paying attention towards their finances more keenly.
