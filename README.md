# Predicting_Customer_Churn

### Business Problem
There is a lot of competition between different credit card companies these days. Each company is trying to offer the best of the services and trying to become the monopolist in the market. But due to the recent trends in the market and also because of the COVID aftermath a lot of people are paying attention towards their finances more keenly. The bank's manager is concerned that more and more consumers are abandoning their credit card services. They would definitely like it if someone could foresee who was going to leave so they could reach out to them in advance, improve their services, and influence customers' decisions.
